# Unicorns-and-Stuff Story #

Once upon a time, in a land far away called CandyLand, there lived Cutiecorn. He was a humble, hard-working unicorn, single father of 3, as his wife had passed away two and a half years ago. Every unicorn in this magical land lived in peace and prosperity, and believed in the 5 true gods, the code cadets. 
	Little did they know, those so called “gods” were merely following orders when something went… TERRIBLY WRONG! They had been tasked with a new experiment, but, when trying to merge two git branches, they tempered with the balance of the universe , putting together two alternate realities. 
	Well, you see, in another dimension, Cutiecorn was known by a different name… NAZICORN. This universe was ruled by CRAZY ASS NAZI UNICORNS, and Nazicorn was none other than the biggest tyrant known to unicorns.
	Since the code cadets knew exactly what they were doing, they obviously fucked this up. They had messed with the space time continuum and accidentally forgot to fix the biggest collision they had ever seen in their whole lives. They kept both Cutiecorn and Nazicorn in the same reality, same place, same time. Doesn’t seem like a big deal, right ? Wrong, extremely wrong. This was not supposed to happen, and the unicorns were about to realise that !
	Both unicorns were facing each other, with extreme suspicion. They knew each other somehow, but they had no idea how. Unfortunately there was no time to figure that out, since Nazicorn felt the urge to conquer this very familiar land. Obviously, Cutiecorn didn’t approve this, since he loved his land so very much and wanted to protect it and his children. 
	As Nazicorn began to orchestrate his malefic plan, Cutiecorn was getting ready for war ! He would not stand idle to this spontaneous threat, he went straight in. TO BATTLE !!!
	
  The code cadets panicked!
“Holy shit, we need to fix this. Send STUFF their way !” said Jonas-chan.

Edu-chan replied “Send them meteors!” 

Nuno-chan: ”And traps !!” 

Raquel-chan: “AND POOOOOOOOP !!!”

To this Azix-chan replied: “And … “

Everyone else: “Ok it’s settled. Meteors, traps and poop it is !”

  As the two unicorns started to fight, they started to be bombarded with stuff from the gods. They are fighting against each other, but also against the world. Who will survive? Their faith is in your hands, fix what the 5 code cadet gods could not !
